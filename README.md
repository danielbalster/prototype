## purpose

This provides a small framework to prototype ideas, especially regardings multi-selection in games.

- a world with many units
- each unit has a 2D position
- each unit can have a behavior tree
- a simple 3D scene lets you explore the situation
- a simple behavior tree editor lets you toy around with unit behavior

## input actions

- there is only one selection
- there is only one highlight (units in the center)
- create groups by assigning a group id to the selection
- create selections by adding/removing highlighted units to the selection
- there is a target cursor which can be turned on/off
-
